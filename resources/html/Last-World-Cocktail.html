The last word cocktail is a classic that offers an amazing taste anyone can appreciate. The recipe is simple and the flavor is complex, often surprising drinkers as to how well it works. It's definitely an enlightening gin martini and one that everyone who values fine cocktails should taste at least once because it's an experience you will not forget.According to Ted Saucier's 1951 book, "Bottoms Up," it's believed that the last word was developed during Prohibition at the Detroit Athletic Club. It is arguably one of the better drinks to come out of the nationwide "drought" when spirits were either hard to find or of the inferior "bathtub" quality. It has stood the test of time and is a spectacular drink that continues to receive a well-deserved spotlight on many modern cocktail menus. It's also one of the most sophisticated green cocktails you'll find.
